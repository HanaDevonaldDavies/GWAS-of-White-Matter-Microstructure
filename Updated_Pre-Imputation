start: MBBrains_R123_3oct2016_step5 (SNPs = 233075; individuals 385)
markers were excluded if chromosome or position was missing (removed = 0)
markers were excluded if alleles were indel or missing (0) (removed = 97)
markers were de-duplicated based on location and allele (including strand awareness) (removed = 0)
markers were renamed to match hrc1.1 nomenclature (SNPs = 232978)
build was converted from hg18 to hg19 
quality control was applied
markers were excluded if allele frequency > 10sd from expected (reference) allele frequency (removed = 13)
markers were exclude if missingness > 2% (removed = 341)
individuals were excluded if missingness > 2% (removed = 0)
markers were exclude in HWE p<1e-20 (removed = 0)
individuals were excluded if heterozygosity > 4sd from sample mean (removed = 2)
individuals were excluded if out of family average relatedness across sample was  > .01 (removed = 0)

Binaries were then prepared for michigan imputation 
check allele frequencies (again)
update to HRC1.1 again
force allele A1
convert to vcf
sort and compress using bcftools
impute

Allele Frequency Check: EUR
Mode: QC & Imputation

The imputed data is being downloaded and combined (using the dosage data).
This is converted using the following script in plink2 

plink2 \
    --vcf chr1.Dose.vcf.gz dosage=DS --exclude-if-info "R2<0.3" \
    --make-pgen \
  --maf .01 \
    --out _chr1

To give you a heads up the log files suggest more markers (based on chromosome 1);
input: 18367 markers
post imputation 3738261 markers
limit to R2<0.3 977805 markers
limit to maf > 0.01 706237 markers
